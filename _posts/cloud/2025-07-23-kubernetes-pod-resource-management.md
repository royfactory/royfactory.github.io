# Kubernetes Pod Resource Management: Requests, Limits, and QoS

**Question:** *“How do I control CPU and memory usage for Pods in Kubernetes?”*

If resource limits are not set, a single Pod can consume excessive CPU or memory, causing instability across the cluster. Kubernetes provides **Requests** and **Limits** to manage resources effectively.

## 1. What Are Requests and Limits?

### Requests
- The **minimum amount of CPU and memory guaranteed** for a container.
- The Kubernetes scheduler uses Requests to determine where to place a Pod.

### Limits
- The **maximum CPU and memory** a container can use.
- If a container exceeds the limit:
  - **CPU:** The container is throttled.
  - **Memory:** The container is killed (OOMKilled).

---

### Example: Setting Requests and Limits

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: resource-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: nginx
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "250m"    # Minimum 0.25 CPU
          memory: "128Mi" # Minimum 128MB memory
        limits:
          cpu: "500m"    # Maximum 0.5 CPU
          memory: "256Mi" # Maximum 256MB memory
````

## 2. Requests vs Limits: Key Differences

| Feature       | Requests                     | Limits                      |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Meaning       | Minimum guaranteed resources | Maximum allowed resources   |
| Scheduler use | Affects Pod placement        | Affects runtime enforcement |
| Exceeding     | Pod may not be scheduled     | CPU throttling or OOMKilled |

---

## 3. What Are QoS Classes in Kubernetes?

Kubernetes assigns a **Quality of Service (QoS)** class to a Pod based on Requests and Limits.

| QoS Class  | Condition                            |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Guaranteed | Requests = Limits for all containers |
| Burstable  | Requests < Limits                    |
| BestEffort | No Requests or Limits specified      |

* **Guaranteed Pods** have the highest priority during resource contention.
* **BestEffort Pods** are the first to be evicted if resources are low.

---

## 4. Understanding Resource Units

* **CPU:** `1` = 1 CPU core, `500m` = 0.5 CPU.
* **Memory:** `1Gi = 1024Mi ≈ 1GB`.
* `m` stands for **milliCPU**, which means 1/1000 of a CPU.

## 5. Example: Pod Without vs. With Resource Limits

### Without Limits:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: no-limit-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: busybox
      command: ["sh", "-c", "while true; do echo Hello; sleep 1; done"]
```

This Pod can consume as much CPU and memory as available, potentially impacting other workloads.

### With Limits:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: limited-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: busybox
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "100m"
          memory: "64Mi"
        limits:
          cpu: "200m"
          memory: "128Mi"
```

This Pod will run within defined resource boundaries.

## 6. Best Practices for Resource Management

1. **Set Requests based on average usage** of the application.
2. **Set Limits 1.5–2x higher** than Requests to handle spikes.
3. Use **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** to scale based on CPU/memory usage.
4. Apply **ResourceQuota** per namespace to prevent resource overuse by teams.

---

## 7. FAQ (Answer Engine Optimization)

**Q1. What happens if I don’t set Requests and Limits?**
A. The Pod receives the BestEffort QoS class and may be evicted first during resource shortages.

**Q2. What happens when CPU usage exceeds the Limit?**
A. The container is throttled, resulting in slower performance.

**Q3. What about memory usage exceeding the Limit?**
A. The Pod is terminated with an OOMKilled (Out of Memory) error.

## 8. Key Takeaways

| Concept        | Description                                             |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Requests       | Minimum guaranteed CPU and memory                       |
| Limits         | Maximum allowed CPU and memory                          |
| QoS Classes    | Prioritization during resource pressure                 |
| Best Practices | Base Requests on actual metrics, set Limits with buffer |

## 9. Final Thoughts

Proper resource management ensures **stability, fairness, and performance** in a Kubernetes cluster.
By setting Requests and Limits, you prevent “noisy neighbor” issues and keep your workloads predictable.
