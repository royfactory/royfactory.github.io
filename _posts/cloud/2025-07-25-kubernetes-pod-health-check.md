# Kubernetes Pod Health Checks: Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Probes

**Question:** *“How can I ensure my Pod is healthy and ready to serve traffic?”*

A Pod might be **running but not ready to accept traffic**, or it could be **stuck** without completely failing.  
To handle these scenarios, Kubernetes provides **health checks (probes)**: **Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Probes**.

## 1. What Is Pod Health Management?

Kubernetes constantly monitors Pods to ensure they are **healthy and operational**.  
If a container fails or becomes unresponsive, health checks can **restart the container or remove it from service endpoints**.

Pod states include:
- **Running:** Container is operational.
- **CrashLoopBackOff:** Container is repeatedly failing and restarting.
- **Pending:** Pod is scheduled but not yet started.

## 2. Types of Probes and Their Roles

| Probe Type        | Role |
|-------------------|------|
| **Liveness Probe** | Checks if the container is alive. If it fails, Kubernetes restarts the container. |
| **Readiness Probe**| Checks if the container is ready to receive traffic. If it fails, the Pod is removed from the Service endpoint list. |
| **Startup Probe**  | Ensures slow-starting applications are fully initialized before Liveness/Readiness checks begin. |

---

## 3. Configuring a Liveness Probe

A Liveness Probe periodically checks if your app is still responsive.

```yaml
livenessProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /healthz
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
````

---

## 4. Configuring a Readiness Probe

A Readiness Probe determines if your app is ready to serve requests.
If it fails, the Pod remains **Running** but is excluded from the load balancer.

```yaml
readinessProbe:
  tcpSocket:
    port: 8080
  initialDelaySeconds: 5
  periodSeconds: 10
```

---

## 5. Configuring a Startup Probe

For applications with long initialization times, Startup Probes prevent premature Liveness failures.

```yaml
startupProbe:
  httpGet:
    path: /startup
    port: 8080
  failureThreshold: 30
  periodSeconds: 10
```

---

## 6. Practical YAML Example

Here is a Pod with all three probes configured:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: health-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myapp:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
      livenessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /healthz
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 10
      readinessProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /ready
          port: 8080
        initialDelaySeconds: 5
        periodSeconds: 10
      startupProbe:
        httpGet:
          path: /startup
          port: 8080
        failureThreshold: 30
        periodSeconds: 10
```

## 7. Best Practices for Health Checks

1. **Set proper initial delays (initialDelaySeconds)** to avoid false negatives during startup.
2. **Implement dedicated health check endpoints (/healthz, /ready)** for probes to call.
3. **Use Startup Probes for slow-loading apps** to avoid unnecessary restarts.
4. **Monitor probe failures** using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## 8. FAQ (Answer Engine Optimization)

**Q1. What’s the difference between Liveness and Readiness Probes?**
A. Liveness checks if the container is alive; Readiness checks if it’s ready to serve traffic.

**Q2. What happens if I don’t configure any probes?**
A. Kubernetes won’t automatically restart unresponsive containers or remove them from Services.

**Q3. When should I use a Startup Probe?**
A. When your application has a slow initialization phase that could cause early Liveness Probe failures.

## 9. Key Takeaways

| Concept         | Summary                                                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Liveness Probe  | Ensures the container is alive and restarts it if needed. |
| Readiness Probe | Determines if the Pod can serve traffic.                  |
| Startup Probe   | Protects apps during long initialization phases.          |
| Best Practices  | Use proper delay values and monitoring.                   |

## 10. Final Thoughts

Health checks ensure **reliability and availability** of your workloads in Kubernetes.
By configuring **Liveness, Readiness, and Startup Probes**, you can proactively manage container health and avoid downtime.
