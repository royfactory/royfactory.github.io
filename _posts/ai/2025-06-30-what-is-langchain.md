# What is LangChain? Build LLM Apps Easily with Python

LangChain is an open-source Python framework designed to make it easy to build applications powered by **large language models (LLMs)** like ChatGPT. It provides components to manage prompts, chain logic, memory, tools, and more.

Whether you’re building a chatbot, a document search tool, or an agent that uses tools like calculators or web search, **LangChain simplifies the process**.

---

## Why LangChain?

Imagine you want to build a customer support chatbot that can:
- Understand user questions
- Retrieve relevant documents
- Summarize answers
- Respond like a helpful assistant

Doing this manually with raw API calls is complex and messy.  
**LangChain connects all these pieces** into reusable, well-structured components—like building blocks for LLM applications.

---

## Core Features of LangChain

### 1. PromptTemplate

Create reusable and dynamic prompts.

```python
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

template = "You are a helpful assistant. Question: {question}"
prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(template)

print(prompt.format(question="What is Python?"))
````

---

### 2. LLMChain

Combine a prompt and a model to process user input.

```python
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

llm = OpenAI(model_name="gpt-3.5-turbo", temperature=0.7)
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

response = chain.run("What is LangChain?")
print(response)
```

---

### 3. Memory

Enable multi-turn conversations by storing chat history.

```python
from langchain.chains import ConversationChain
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

conversation = ConversationChain(
    llm=llm,
    memory=ConversationBufferMemory()
)

print(conversation.run("Hello!"))
print(conversation.run("What did I just say?"))
```

---

### 4. Tools and Agents

Let LLMs use external tools like calculators or APIs with decision-making.

```python
from langchain.agents import load_tools, initialize_agent
from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType

tools = load_tools(["llm-math"], llm=llm)
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, verbose=True
)

print(agent.run("What is 25 * 38?"))
```

---

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **AI Chatbots** – Context-aware assistants that remember conversations
2. **Document Q\&A** – Search and summarize internal knowledge bases
3. **AI Agents** – Perform reasoning and take actions using tools
4. **Custom LLM APIs** – Expose internal business logic via natural language

---

## Benefits of LangChain

* **Modular:** Build apps with pluggable components
* **Scalable:** Suitable for small scripts or full-stack apps
* **Flexible:** Works with OpenAI, HuggingFace, Cohere, and more
* **Memory-friendly:** Maintain context across conversations
* **Tool Integration:** Connect to databases, search engines, APIs, etc.

---

## Limitations of LangChain

* **Learning curve:** Some abstractions may be confusing at first
* **Debugging chains:** Chained components can make tracing bugs harder
* **Performance overhead:** Complex chains may increase latency

---

## Summary

LangChain helps developers go **beyond simple prompts** by offering a structured way to build intelligent LLM-powered applications.

Whether you’re building a chatbot, a Q\&A assistant, or an autonomous AI agent, LangChain gives you the tools to do it **cleanly, scalably, and with less code**.
