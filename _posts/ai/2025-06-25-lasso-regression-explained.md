# What is Lasso Regression?

Lasso Regression is an extension of linear regression designed to reduce **overfitting** and improve **model simplicity**. It’s especially helpful when dealing with high-dimensional data by automatically **eliminating irrelevant features**, making the model more interpretable and efficient.

---

## Concept of Lasso Regression

**Lasso** stands for *Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator*. It is a linear regression model that includes an **L1 regularization term** to penalize large coefficients.

### Standard Linear Regression Equation:
```

y = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ + ε

```

### Lasso Regression Loss Function:
```

Loss = RSS + λ \* Σ|βᵢ|

````
- `RSS`: Residual Sum of Squares  
- `λ`: Regularization strength (higher λ means more shrinkage)
- `Σ|βᵢ|`: Sum of the absolute values of the coefficients (L1 norm)

The L1 penalty causes some coefficients to shrink to **exactly zero**, which effectively **removes those variables** from the model.

## Real-World Example: House Price Prediction

Imagine you're building a model to predict house prices with features like:

- Size (sqft)
- Number of rooms
- Elevator availability
- Year built
- Complex name
- Maintenance fee  
- ...

Some of these variables may not significantly impact the price. Lasso Regression automatically **eliminates less important features** by assigning their coefficients to zero, leaving only the most relevant predictors.

---

## When to Use Lasso?

1. **High-dimensional datasets**
   - Especially useful when the number of features is large or features are correlated.
2. **Need for feature selection**
   - Lasso automatically performs variable selection.
3. **Interpretability**
   - It produces simpler, more interpretable models by reducing the number of active features.

---

## Limitations of Lasso

1. **Unstable when features > samples**
   - It may not select the correct variables in such cases.
2. **Biased estimation**
   - Coefficients are biased due to the shrinkage effect.
3. **Sensitivity to correlated variables**
   - Among highly correlated features, Lasso tends to select one and ignore the others.

## Comparison: Lasso vs Ridge vs ElasticNet

| Model         | Regularization | Feature Elimination | Key Feature                        |
|---------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Ridge         | L2 (squared)   | ✗                    | Shrinks all coefficients            |
| Lasso         | L1 (absolute)  | ✓                    | Eliminates some coefficients to 0   |
| ElasticNet    | L1 + L2        | ✓                    | Hybrid of Ridge and Lasso           |

## Scikit-Learn Example

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load data
X, y = load_boston(return_X_y=True)

# Split train/test
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
lasso = Lasso(alpha=1.0)
lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict and evaluate
y_pred = lasso.predict(X_test)
print("MSE:", mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred))
print("Coefficients:", lasso.coef_)
````

## Summary

Lasso Regression is a powerful technique that enhances linear regression by **simplifying models** and reducing overfitting through L1 regularization. Its ability to **perform automatic feature selection** makes it particularly useful in real-world applications involving many variables.

For interpretable, efficient, and generalizable models, Lasso Regression is a go-to method in the machine learning toolbox.
