# Machine Learning Basics: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement Learning (Lecture 2)

This is Lecture 2 of our AI 101 series. We'll break down **three core types of Machine Learning**, explore their **real-world applications**, and finish with a **verified scikit-learn lab** that runs locally without internet access.

## 1) What Is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is the process of teaching computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions **without being explicitly programmed with rules**.

Instead of telling the computer *how* to solve a problem, we give it **examples** (data) and let it find the rules itself.

---

### Everyday ML Examples

* **Spam filters**: Learn patterns of spam vs. normal emails.
* **Speech recognition**: Trained on thousands of hours of audio.
* **Recommendation engines**: Suggest products or content based on user behavior.
* **Self-driving cars**: Learn road patterns from camera/sensor data.

## 2) Three Main Types of Machine Learning

---

### 2.1 Supervised Learning

* Learns from **labeled data** (input + correct output).
* Analogy: Studying with both the questions and the answer key.
* **Tasks**:

  * **Classification**: Predict a category (spam vs. ham).
  * **Regression**: Predict a continuous value (house prices).

| Task Type      | Output Type | Example                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Classification | Categorical | Spam/Not spam, Iris species |
| Regression     | Continuous  | Predicting stock prices     |

---

### 2.2 Unsupervised Learning

* Learns from **unlabeled data** (only inputs, no answers).
* Analogy: Grouping similar exam questions without knowing the correct answers.
* **Tasks**:

  * **Clustering**: Group similar data points.
  * **Dimensionality Reduction**: Reduce features while preserving key info.

| Method                   | Description                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Clustering               | Groups data points based on similarity.          |
| Dimensionality Reduction | Compresses features while keeping core patterns. |

---

### 2.3 Reinforcement Learning

* Learns by **interacting with an environment**: takes an action, gets a reward, and adjusts.
* Analogy: Learning to play a game by trial and error to maximize the score.
* **Applications**:

  * AlphaGo (Go-playing AI)
  * Robotics
  * Autonomous driving

## 3) General ML Development Workflow

1. **Data Collection**: CSV, databases, APIs, etc.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing/outlier values, normalize features.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose based on the task type.
4. **Training**: Fit the model to the data.
5. **Evaluation**: Measure performance (accuracy, F1-score, etc.).
6. **Deployment**: Integrate the model into production.

## 4) Hands-On Lab: Classifying Iris Species

We'll use scikit-learn's built-in **Iris dataset** for a **safe, offline, beginner-friendly** supervised learning demo.

> **Setup**
>
> ```bash
> pip install scikit-learn matplotlib
> ```

```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, ConfusionMatrixDisplay
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1. Load dataset
iris = load_iris()
X, y = iris.data, iris.target

# 2. Train/test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# 3. Create and train model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=200)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# 4. Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# 5. Evaluate
print("Accuracy:", f"{accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)*100:.2f}%")
print("\nClassification report:\n", classification_report(y_test, y_pred, target_names=iris.target_names))

# 6. Visualize confusion matrix
ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_estimator(model, X_test, y_test, display_labels=iris.target_names)
plt.show()
```

**Expected Output**

```
Accuracy: 100.00%
Classification report:
              precision    recall  f1-score   support
    setosa       1.00      1.00      1.00        10
versicolor       1.00      1.00      1.00        10
 virginica       1.00      1.00      1.00        10
```

## 5) Key Takeaways

* **Supervised Learning**: Learns from labeled data (classification/regression).
* **Unsupervised Learning**: Finds structure in unlabeled data (clustering/dimensionality reduction).
* **Reinforcement Learning**: Learns via trial-and-error feedback.
* Hands-on: Successfully trained a simple supervised learning model offline.

## 6) FAQ (Answer Engine Optimization)

**Q1. Which type of ML is most common in business?**
A. Supervised learning—most business problems have historical labeled data.

**Q2. Do I need deep learning for every ML task?**
A. No. Many tasks are better handled with traditional ML models like logistic regression or random forests.

**Q3. Can I mix these learning types?**
A. Yes, hybrid approaches exist (e.g., semi-supervised learning).

**Q4. Does reinforcement learning need huge compute?**
A. For complex tasks, yes—but simple simulations can run on a laptop.
