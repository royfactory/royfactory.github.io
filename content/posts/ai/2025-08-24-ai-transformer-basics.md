# Transformer Architecture Basics: From Attention to Modern AI (Lecture 15)

In this lecture, we’ll introduce the **Transformer architecture**, which has become the foundation of modern AI models like **GPT** and **BERT**.  
Unlike RNNs or LSTMs that process sequences step by step, Transformers rely entirely on **attention mechanisms** and allow **parallel processing**, making them both **faster** and **more effective**.

## 1) Why Transformers?

Traditional sequence models like RNNs and LSTMs process data sequentially, making training slow and prone to long-term dependency issues.  

Transformers solve this by:
- Using **self-attention** to capture relationships between words  
- Allowing **parallel computation** across the entire sequence  
- Scaling well to large datasets and modern hardware  

---

## 2) Core Components of the Transformer

1. **Self-Attention**  
   Each word attends to other words in the sentence to capture context.  
   Example: “The cat sat on the mat because **it** was tired.” → “it” refers to “cat.”

2. **Multi-Head Attention**  
   Multiple attention heads focus on different types of relationships simultaneously (syntax, semantics, etc.).

3. **Positional Encoding**  
   Since Transformers don’t inherently understand order, positional encodings (sinusoidal functions) are added to embeddings to preserve sequence information.

4. **Feed-Forward Network (FFN)**  
   A fully connected layer applied to each position independently for richer representation.

5. **Residual Connections + Layer Normalization**  
   Help stabilize and speed up training.

---

## 3) Encoder-Decoder Structure

- **Encoder**: Reads the input sequence and generates a context representation.  
- **Decoder**: Uses the encoder’s output and attention to generate the target sequence.  

For tasks like classification or embeddings, only the **encoder** is often used.  
For machine translation, both encoder and decoder are necessary.

---

## 4) Intuitive Analogy

Think of a **meeting discussion**:  
- Self-attention = deciding which participant’s statement is most relevant  
- Multi-head attention = multiple note-takers, each focusing on different perspectives  
- Positional encoding = marking who spoke first, second, and so on

## 5) Hands-On: Simple Transformer Encoder in TensorFlow

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers

# Input (batch=1, tokens=5, dimension=16)
x = tf.random.normal((1, 5, 16))

# Multi-Head Attention
attn = layers.MultiHeadAttention(num_heads=2, key_dim=16)
out1 = attn(x, x)  # Self-Attention

# Residual + LayerNorm
out1 = layers.LayerNormalization()(x + out1)

# Feed-Forward Network
ffn = tf.keras.Sequential([
    layers.Dense(64, activation="relu"),
    layers.Dense(16)
])
out2 = ffn(out1)

# Residual + LayerNorm
encoder_output = layers.LayerNormalization()(out1 + out2)

print("Encoder output shape:", encoder_output.shape)
````

**Expected Output:**

```
Encoder output shape: (1, 5, 16)
```

## 6) Advantages of Transformers

* **Parallel training** → much faster than RNNs
* **Handles long dependencies** via self-attention
* **Versatility** → applied to NLP, vision, speech, and more

---

## 7) Key Takeaways

* Transformers are built entirely on **attention mechanisms**.
* The architecture consists of **encoder-decoder blocks**.
* They are the backbone of state-of-the-art models like GPT and BERT.

## 8) What’s Next?

In **Lecture 16**, we’ll explore **BERT architecture and pretraining techniques**, one of the most widely used Transformer-based models in NLP.
