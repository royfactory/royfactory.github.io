# AI Project Planning and Real-World Applications (Lecture 20)

This is the final lecture of our 20-part series. We’ll conclude by discussing how to **plan, design, and execute AI projects** in real-world scenarios.  
You’ll learn about the **AI project lifecycle**, practical applications in various industries, and how to deploy models into production.

## 1) AI Project Lifecycle

AI projects go beyond just training a model. They require a complete end-to-end strategy:

1. **Problem Definition (Business Understanding)**  
   - What problem are we solving?  
   - Example: Automating customer service, demand forecasting, or translation.  

2. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - High-quality data is critical for model performance.  
   - Includes text, images, logs, and multimodal sources.  

3. **Model Selection & Training**  
   - Choose between supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement learning.  
   - Fine-tune pretrained models (e.g., BERT, GPT, CLIP).  

4. **Deployment & MLOps**  
   - Expose models via APIs, web apps, or mobile apps.  
   - Monitor performance and update models regularly.

## 2) Real-World Applications

### NLP (Natural Language Processing)
- **Chatbots** for customer support (GPT-based assistants)  
- **Document Summarization** for news, reports, or research  

### Computer Vision
- **Quality Inspection** in manufacturing  
- **Medical Imaging** for diagnosis support  

### Multimodal AI
- **Image Retrieval** (search images with text queries)  
- **Autonomous Driving** (combining vision + sensor data)

## 3) Hands-On Example: Designing a News Summarization Service

Imagine building an AI project for automatic news summarization:

1. **Define the Problem** → Provide concise summaries to readers  
2. **Collect Data** → Crawl news articles and preprocess text  
3. **Model Training** → Fine-tune `BART` or `T5` for summarization  
4. **Deploy** → Expose via Flask/Django API and integrate with UI  

Example Flask API:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

@app.route("/summarize", methods=["POST"])
def summarize():
    text = request.json.get("text")
    summary = summarizer(text, max_length=50, min_length=10, do_sample=False)
    return jsonify({"summary": summary[0]['summary_text']})

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
````

## 4) Key Takeaways

* AI projects must align with **business problems**, not just technology
* **Data quality** is as important as algorithms
* **MLOps** ensures stability, monitoring, and scalability in production
* Start small, then expand applications as confidence and results grow
