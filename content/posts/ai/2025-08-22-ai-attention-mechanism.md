# Attention Mechanism Basics: Understanding Query, Key, and Value (Lecture 14)

In this lecture, we’ll explore the **Attention Mechanism**, one of the most impactful innovations in deep learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP).  
The key idea is simple: instead of treating all words equally, the model **focuses on the most relevant words** to improve context understanding.

## 1) Why Attention Matters

Traditional sequence models like **RNN, LSTM, and GRU** struggle with long sentences, often forgetting earlier information.  
Example:

> "I watched a movie with a friend yesterday, had dinner, and read a book. The movie was really fun."

To correctly interpret "The movie," the model must **recall the earlier mention of "movie"**, which RNNs often fail to do.  
**Attention solves this by assigning higher weights to important words.**

---

## 2) Core Idea of Attention

Attention relies on three key components:

- **Query (Q):** What we’re looking for  
- **Key (K):** What each word represents  
- **Value (V):** The actual information carried  

### Formula
```

Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(QKᵀ / √d\_k) V

````

- `QKᵀ` → similarity between words  
- `softmax` → converts similarity into probability weights  
- Final output is a **weighted sum of Values**

---

## 3) Intuitive Example

Sentence: *"The cat sat on the mat because it was tired."*  
Here, the word **"it"** refers to **"cat"**.  
Attention assigns **higher weight to "cat"** when interpreting "it."

## 4) Hands-On: Implementing Simple Attention (TensorFlow)

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Example input (batch=1, words=5, embedding_dim=8)
x = tf.random.normal(shape=(1, 5, 8))

# Define Q, K, V projections
Wq = tf.keras.layers.Dense(8)
Wk = tf.keras.layers.Dense(8)
Wv = tf.keras.layers.Dense(8)

Q = Wq(x)
K = Wk(x)
V = Wv(x)

# Compute attention scores
scores = tf.matmul(Q, K, transpose_b=True) / tf.math.sqrt(tf.cast(8, tf.float32))
weights = tf.nn.softmax(scores, axis=-1)

# Output vector
output = tf.matmul(weights, V)

print("Attention Weights:", weights.numpy())
print("Output Shape:", output.shape)
````

**Sample Output:**

```
Attention Weights: [[0.21 0.18 0.25 0.19 0.17], ...]
Output Shape: (1, 5, 8)
```

This shows how each word distributes its focus across other words.

## 5) Advantages of Attention

1. **Handles long dependencies** – connects distant words easily
2. **Parallelizable** – faster training than RNNs
3. **Interpretability** – we can visualize attention weights to understand focus

---

## 6) Key Takeaways

* Attention introduces the concept of "focus" in neural networks
* Query, Key, and Value drive context-aware understanding
* TensorFlow example demonstrated how attention weights distribute across words

## 7) What’s Next?

In **Lecture 15**, we’ll dive into the **Transformer architecture**, which builds entirely on attention and powers modern models like GPT and BERT.
