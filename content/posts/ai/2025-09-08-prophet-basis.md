## Introduction
**Prophet** is a calendar-aware additive model that mixes trend, seasonalities, and holiday effects with robust defaults, making it ideal for fast, business-facing forecasts. It ships for Python and R, is resilient to missing data/outliers, and includes built-in tools for time-series cross-validation. Recent 1.1.x releases rely on a cmdstan backend and add practical improvements like `scaling`.

## Core Model Concepts
### Additive structure
\(y(t)=g(t)+s(t)+h(t)+\epsilon_t\) with linear/logistic trend \(g(t)\), yearly/weekly/daily seasonalities \(s(t)\), holiday effects \(h(t)\), and noise. Works best when strong calendar seasonality exists and you have several seasons of history.

### Installation
- **Python**: `python -m pip install prophet` or `conda install -c conda-forge prophet`  
  Name changed from `fbprophet` → `prophet` at v1.0. Min Python ≥3.7.  
- **Backend**: Python switched to **cmdstan + cmdstanpy**; binaries are prepackaged and a fixed cmdstan is downloaded by default.

## Quick Start (Python)
```python
import pandas as pd
from prophet import Prophet

df = pd.read_csv("series.csv")  # must have ds, y
df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ds'])

m = Prophet(seasonality_mode="additive", changepoint_prior_scale=0.05, interval_width=0.95)
m.add_country_holidays(country_name='US')
m.add_seasonality(name='monthly', period=30.5, fourier_order=5)
m.fit(df)

future = m.make_future_dataframe(periods=90, freq='D')
forecast = m.predict(future)

m.plot(forecast); m.plot_components(forecast);
```

## Tuning the Model

### Trend & changepoints

Control flexibility with `changepoint_prior_scale`, define search region via `changepoint_range`, or specify changepoint dates explicitly. Use CV to avoid over/underfitting.

### Seasonalities & modes

Enable/disable yearly/weekly/daily; add custom seasonalities; pick `"additive"` vs `"multiplicative"` depending on scale effects.

### Holidays & events

`add_country_holidays(country_name=...)` to include built-in holiday calendars; or pass a custom holiday dataframe with windows around events (e.g., Black Friday ±1 day).

### Newer options (1.1.5+)

`scaling={'absmax','minmax'}` controls target scaling; NumPy 2.0 and Apple Silicon support improvements are included in recent releases.

## Cross-Validation & Metrics

Prophet provides rolling-origin CV:

```python
from prophet.diagnostics import cross_validation, performance_metrics
df_cv = cross_validation(m, horizon='30 days', period='15 days', initial='365 days')
df_pm = performance_metrics(df_cv)  # rmse, mae, mape, coverage
```

Plot error vs. horizon with `plot_cross_validation_metric`.

## Production Tips

* Ensure at least 2–3 seasons of history; prevent leakage in feature engineering.
* Maintain profiles by horizon (7/30/90d).
* Use domain-driven regressors (price, promo, weather) via `add_regressor`.
* Inspect components to validate business narratives.

## Conclusion

Prophet is a strong baseline for calendar-driven series thanks to its additive structure, holiday awareness, and robust defaults. Pair hypothesis-led feature design with CV-based tuning to reach reliable forecasts—then consider advanced models only if they beat this baseline.

### Summary

* Calendar-aware additive model with trend, seasonalities, holidays
* Simple API for fast baselines; resilient to missing data/outliers
* cmdstan backend since 1.1.x; easier installs and better compatibility
* Use CV (`cross_validation`, `performance_metrics`) to tune changepoints/seasonalities
* Add domain regressors and custom holidays for lift
