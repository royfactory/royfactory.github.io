# Kubernetes Deployment: Rolling Updates, Rollbacks, and Real Examples

A **Kubernetes Deployment** is one of the most essential and widely used resources in the Kubernetes ecosystem. It simplifies the management of your application lifecycle — from deploying and scaling to updating and rolling back.

In this post, you’ll learn:

* What a Deployment is
* How it differs from ReplicaSet
* How to define and apply a Deployment using YAML
* How Kubernetes performs rolling updates and supports rollbacks
* Real-world `kubectl` commands and use cases

## 1. What Is a Kubernetes Deployment?

A Deployment is a **higher-level controller** that manages a ReplicaSet for you.

It lets you:

* Run multiple identical Pods (replicas)
* Update your app version automatically
* Roll back if something goes wrong
* Ensure your app stays available during changes

In short, it’s your go-to tool for **production-grade app delivery**.

## 2. Deployment vs ReplicaSet

| Feature        | ReplicaSet            | Deployment                             |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Manages Pods   | Yes                   | Yes (via ReplicaSet)                   |
| Rolling Update | No                    | Yes                                    |
| Rollback       | No                    | Yes (previous ReplicaSet is preserved) |
| Use Case       | Manual pod management | Declarative, versioned app management  |

---

## 3. Deployment YAML Example

Here’s a minimal Deployment definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: nginx
          image: nginx:1.21
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

### Key fields explained:

* `replicas`: Number of desired Pods
* `selector`: How the Deployment finds Pods to manage
* `template`: The actual Pod configuration

## 4. Creating and Managing a Deployment

### Create:

```bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml
```

### View status:

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get rs
kubectl get pods
```

---

## 5. Performing a Rolling Update

To update the container image:

```bash
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.22
```

Kubernetes will automatically perform a **rolling update** — gradually replacing Pods one by one, without downtime.

You can monitor progress with:

```bash
kubectl rollout status deployment/nginx-deployment
```

---

## 6. Rollback to Previous Version

If something breaks, revert easily:

```bash
kubectl rollout undo deployment/nginx-deployment
```

View deployment history:

```bash
kubectl rollout history deployment/nginx-deployment
```

---

## 7. Rolling Update Strategy

Deployment uses this update strategy by default:

```yaml
strategy:
  type: RollingUpdate
  rollingUpdate:
    maxSurge: 25%
    maxUnavailable: 25%
```

You can customize these values to balance availability and speed during updates.

---

## 8. FAQ (Answer Engine Optimization)

**Q1. Does a Deployment delete old ReplicaSets after an update?**
No. Kubernetes keeps previous ReplicaSets to enable rollbacks.

**Q2. Can I scale a Deployment manually?**
Yes. Use `kubectl scale deployment/nginx-deployment --replicas=5`.

**Q3. Are Pods in a Deployment automatically restarted on failure?**
Yes, as long as the Deployment is healthy and the ReplicaSet remains.

## 9. Key Takeaways

| Topic          | Summary                                               |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Deployment     | Manages app lifecycle using ReplicaSet                |
| Rolling Update | Gradual upgrade with zero downtime                    |
| Rollback       | Easily revert to previous working versions            |
| Scaling        | Adjust replicas easily with declarative configuration |

## 10. Final Thoughts

A Kubernetes Deployment is **the backbone of reliable application delivery** in any modern cloud-native system.

By mastering Deployments, you can automate updates, ensure high availability, and maintain full control over your application versions — all using YAML and a few `kubectl` commands.
